# Before you start

Before you jump in to any tutorials, we recommend you do the following:

## Understand Jina

Read through an {ref}`introduction to Jina concepts <architecture-overview>` to understand the basic components that will be used in the tutorial.

## Work in a virtual environment

We highly recommend you work in [a virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to prevent conflicts in packaging versions. This applies not just to Jina, but Python as a whole.

## Install Jina

## Python vs YAML
