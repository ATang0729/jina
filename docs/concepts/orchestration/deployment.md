# Deployment

A {class}`~jina.Deployment` orchestrates a single {class}`~jina.Executor` to accomplish a task.
Documents are processed by Executors.

You can think of a Deployment as an interface to configure and launch your {ref}`microservice architecture <architecture-overview>`,
while the heavy lifting is done by the {ref}`service <executor-cookbook>` itself.
In particular, each Deployment also launches a {ref}`Gateway <gateway>` service, which can expose the service through an API that you define.

The most important methods of the `Deployment` object are the following:

| Method                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This will start all its Executors and check if they are ready to be used.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| {meth}`~jina.Deployment.close()`                                   | Stops and closes the Deployment.

## Why should you use a Deployment?

Once you've learned DocumentArray and Executor, you can split a big task into small independent modules and services.

- Deployments let you scale these Executors independently to match your requirements.

- Deployments let you easily use other cloud-native orchestrators, such as Kubernetes, to manage your service.

## Minimum working example

````{tab} Pythonic style


```python
from jina import Deployment, Executor, requests, Document


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests(on='/bar')
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(docs)


f = Deployment(name='myexec1', uses=MyExecutor)

with dep:
    dep.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```


````

````{tab} Deployment-as-a-Service style

Server:

```python
from jina import Deployment, Executor, requests


class MyExecutor(Executor):
    @requests(on='/bar')
    def foo(self, docs, **kwargs):
        print(docs)


dep = Deployment(port=12345, name='myexec1', uses=MyExecutor)

with dep:
    dep.block()
```

Client:

```python
from jina import Client, Document

c = Client(port=12345)
c.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
```

````

````{tab} Load from YAML

`my.yml`:
```yaml
jtype: Deployment
name: myexec1
uses: FooExecutor
py_modules: exec.py
```

`exec.py`:
```python
from jina import Executor, requests, Document, DocumentArray


class FooExecutor(Executor):
    @requests
    def foo(self, docs: DocumentArray, **kwargs):
        docs.append(Document(text='foo was here'))
```

```python
from jina import Deployment, Document

dep = Deployment.load_config('my.yml')

with dep:
    try:
        dep.post(on='/bar', inputs=Document(), on_done=print)
    except Exception as ex:
        # handle exception
        pass
```

````

```{caution}
The statement `with dep:` starts the Deployment, and exiting the indented with block stops the Deployment, including its Executors.
Exceptions raised inside the `with dep:` block will close the Deployment context manager. If you don't want this, use a `try...except` block to surround the statements that could potentially raise an exception.
```
